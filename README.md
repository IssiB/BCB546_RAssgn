There are a total of 40 .txt files in this document, 20 for maize and 20 for teosinte. These files are organized in "maize_increasing", "maize_decreasing", "teosinte_increasing", and "teosinte_decreasing". Each of these folders contain 10 .txt files for each chromosome (1-10). Files labeled with "chr_increasing" have data organized by increasing SNP position, and those labeled with "chr_decreasing" have data organized by decreasing SNP position. There is also an R Markdown file that contains my code and a description of what the code does ("Burger_R_Assgn.Rmd") as well as an .html format of the same information ("Burger_R_Assgn.html").
