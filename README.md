# BCB546_RAssgn

There are a total of 40 .txt files in this document, 20 for maize and 20 for teosinte. These files are organized in "maize_increasing", "maize_decreasing", "teosinte_increasing", and "teosinte_decreasing". Each of these folders contain 10 .txt files for each chromosome (1-10). Files labeled with "chr_increasing" have data organized by increasing SNP position, and those labeled with "chr_decreasing" have data organized by decreasing SNP position. There is also an R Markdown file that contains my code and a description of what the code does ("Burger_R_Assgn.Rmd") as well as an .html format of the same information ("Burger_R_Assgn.html").

In response to my reviews, I created a new .Rmd file titled "Final_Burger_R_Assgn_with_Changes.Rmd. I also created a new folder titled "Reviews" that contain the two .md files my reviewers pushed to me. In order to see my final .html file as a document (including the changes I made following review), click here: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/IssiB/BCB546_RAssgn/blob/main/Final_Burger_R_Assgn_with_Changes.html
